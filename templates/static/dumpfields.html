<h1>What's in a dump</h1>
Below is a description of the rules by which things are captured. These decisions are the results of feedback from viewers like you. So 
if something doesn't make sense to you, doesn't work as it says it should, or is outright absurd, let me know.
<h2>Headers</h2>
The header is just a dump of the headers in the request with the one note that 
headers inserted by the host (Google Appengine) have been removed to avoid confusing people
<h2>Parameters</h2>
Parses the passed parameters. This uses the same logic as most web frameworks. So it will contain any GET params (query string 
parameters such as ?foo=bar) and if the post request is an application/x-www-form-urlencoded request then it will contain the post 
params. If both are present they will get munged into one grouping. If the toilet is configured to dump the post body before parsing then
The post parameters will only appear in the post body and not here.
<h2>Post Body</h2>
The post body as a string. If the form is of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded then the post body will be consumed by the parameters
parser and will not appear here (unless the toilet is configured to dump post body first).
<h2>Multipart Files</h2>
If the post is of content type multipart/* then this is where any files will go. For a file to be valid it must have a filename.
Note that the content will display encoded when viewing a dump as JSON.
<h2>Multipart Values</h2>
The non-file values submitted as part of a multipart request. Note that the content will display encoded when viewing as JSON.
