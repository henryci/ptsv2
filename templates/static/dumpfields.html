<h1>What's in a dump</h1>
Below is a description of the rules by which things are captured. These decisions are the results of feedback from viewers like you. So 
if something doesn't make sense to you, doesn't work as it says it should, or is outright absurd, let me know.
<h2>Headers</h2>
The header is just a dump of the headers in the request with the one note that 
headers inserted by the host (Google Appengine) have been removed to avoid confusing people
<h2>Post Parameters</h2>
Parses the traditional web form request data if it's there. This should always be blank if the request type is not: 
applicatin/x-www-form-urlencoded data. This is also where GET query parameters (?foo=bar in the URL) will appear.
<h2>Post Body</h2>
The post body as a string.
<h2>Multipart Files</h2>
If the post is of content type multipart/* then this is where any files will go. For a file to be valid it must have a filename.
Note that the content will display encoded when viewing a dump as JSON.
<h2>Multipart Values</h2>
The non-file values submitted as part of a multipart request. Note that the content will display encoded when viewing as JSON.
